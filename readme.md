# Kanban App

This project was originally created by Devstackr.

Also, I've made a few changes to the project:
 - Created an API using Node and Mongo.
 - Added some routes to the API so you could get single entities.
 - Used the entities data whenever we wanted to edit them.

## Descrition

This project uses Angular's CDK and the MEAN Stack. Besides that I used some frameworks such as Bulma, Nodemon, Express, Mongoose and JWT for authentication.
